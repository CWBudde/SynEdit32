SynEdit32
=========

SynEdit32 is based on SynEdit, but based on Graphics32 to be able to simplify some drawing code.

The original project (with the original readme.txt file) is located here:

http://synedit.sourceforge.net

To get started check out the different examples. If you have questions, please subscribe to the SynEdit user list and ask there, if you want to hack SynEdit you should subscribe to the SynEdit developer list. General feedback and suggestions or fixes are welcome.

There is no documentation yet, help in this area is especially welcome!
