SynEdit32
=========

SynEdit32 is a SynEdit fork where the drawing is based on Graphics32. This allowed to simplify some drawing code. However, it does not result in a better performance nor a better quality of the output. It's just easier to understand as a lot of the cryptic GDI calls are simplified now.

The original project (with the original readme.txt file) is located here:

http://synedit.sourceforge.net

and the recent SynEdit fork is available here:

https://github.com/SynEdit/SynEdit

To get started check out the different examples. General feedback and suggestions or fixes are welcome.

There is no documentation yet, help in this area is especially welcome!
